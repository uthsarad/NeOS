# NeOS Mission and Identity

## Core Mission
NeOS is a curated Arch Linux distribution delivering Windows-level usability with Linux-level power. It bridges the gap between the flexibility of Arch Linux and the reliability expected from a consumer operating system.

## Target Audience
- **Windows Switchers:** Users looking for a familiar desktop paradigm (KDE Plasma) without the learning curve of a "do-it-yourself" Linux installation.
- **Stability Seekers:** Users who want the latest software but require a system that doesn't break on updates.
- **Power Users:** Those who appreciate Arch's underlying architecture but prefer a pre-configured, battle-tested starting point.

## What NeOS is NOT
- **Not a Thin Wrapper:** NeOS is not just an installer for upstream Arch packages. We curate, test, and delay updates to ensure stability.
- **Not a DIY Distro:** We provide sensible defaults and pre-configured tools. Users are not expected to edit config files to get basic functionality working.
- **Not a Rolling Beta:** While based on a rolling release model, NeOS employs snapshot-based repositories to prevent partial upgrades and breakage.
