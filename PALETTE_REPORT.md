# Palette Report
## Accessibility fixes
- None required in the evaluated files.
## UX improvements
- Enhanced the graphical notification wrapper in `neos-autoupdate.sh` to accept dynamic titles, icons, and urgency levels.
- Prevented a graceful exit (due to missing `snapper`) from presenting to the user as a critical system failure, changing it instead to an informational "System Update Skipped" dialog.
## Remaining usability risks
- Further system scripts using `notify-send` might also have hardcoded severities; these should be audited as well.
