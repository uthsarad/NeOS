# ⚡ Bolt: Aggressive ZRAM Tuning
# Since we use ZRAM for swap (compressed RAM), we want the kernel to swap aggressively
# rather than dropping file caches. This improves responsiveness under memory pressure.
# 180 is higher than standard Linux max (100) but supported by Zen kernel for ZRAM users.
vm.swappiness = 180

# Default is 3 (read 8 pages). ZRAM is random access RAM, so read 1 page (2^0).
# Reduces read amplification and latency.
vm.page-cluster = 0
