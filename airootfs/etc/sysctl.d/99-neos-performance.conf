# ⚡ Bolt: Aggressive ZRAM Tuning
# Since we use ZRAM for swap (compressed RAM), we want the kernel to swap aggressively
# rather than dropping file caches. This improves responsiveness under memory pressure.
# 180 is higher than standard Linux max (100) but supported by Zen kernel for ZRAM users.
vm.swappiness = 180

# Default is 3 (read 8 pages). ZRAM is random access RAM, so read 1 page (2^0).
# Reduces read amplification and latency.
vm.page-cluster = 0

# ⚡ Bolt: Prefer Cache Retention
# Default is 100. Lowering to 50 causes the kernel to prefer retaining dentry and inode caches.
# This improves filesystem responsiveness (e.g., listing directories, launching apps) at the cost
# of slightly more memory usage for metadata, which is worth it for desktop "snap".
vm.vfs_cache_pressure = 50
