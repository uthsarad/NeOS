# The rule here is: never predict a partition number. parted fills the lowest
# free GPT slot, not "highest existing + 1", so any disk whose numbering has a
# hole — exactly what deleting a partition to free space leaves behind, which
# is what our own partition tool tells the user to do — hands back a number we
# did not choose. Everything below reads back what was actually created.
#
# Sourced, not executed. The configurator defines abort() and
# disk_abort_hook(); tests get the plain fallbacks.

# Partitions this run created, in creation order. rollback_created_parts()
# undoes exactly these and nothing else.
